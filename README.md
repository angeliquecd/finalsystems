Modify your README.md to reflect your actual project, as described on the website:
Our project allows the user to create and navigate their own music library. The user can populate the library with their
Required libraries
-Sox
  apt-get install sox
Instructions
1.Compile the project by typing make , then run it by typing ./go . You will see a screen prompting you with the various actions you can take with the Library
3. To start, type POPULATE, in all-caps as shown, and fill in the music library with information about the built-in files. This is a one-time only action. Trying to play or browse without populating the library will result in an empty library.
4.You can then choose to browse the library, create a playlist, play music, exit the library or delete it entirely. Follow the prompts to complete each action
5. When prompted, always type your choice in all-caps as a single word
  e.g If asked: "Would you like to play a SONG, PLAYLIST, GENRE or ALBUM?"" Type "ALBUM" to play an album.
6. The only way to change the information about a single song is to repopulate the entire library.
7. If the library is deleted, it must be repopulated afterwards.
8. Exiting the program will not delete the library
